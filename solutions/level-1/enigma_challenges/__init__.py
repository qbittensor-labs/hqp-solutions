    Helper base class to handle conversion of (mainly) simple dataclasses to and

    allow for JSON (de)serialization.

    All conversion methods determine an expected data set from annotated
    attributes via `typing.get_type_hints`, which resolves string annotations
    (including those deferred by `from __future__ import annotations`) into real
    type objects. This means any attributes *not* annotated with a type will not
    be processed.

    A dataclass-like `__init__` constructor is also assumed by `from_*` methods,
    which is expected to take arguments in the same order and of the same types
    as the annotated attributes.

    Nested `Serde` subclasses are automatically constructed from dicts during
    deserialization and converted back to dicts during serialization.
