"""
Challenge interface for the mock (plumbing test) challenge.

The mock challenge uses Ed25519 signatures to verify that only authorized
parties can produce valid solutions. The solver signs a time-based payload
with a private key; the validator verifies the signature against a known
public key and checks that the timestamp is within the validity window.

The private key is never included in source code or Docker images. It lives
on the miner's machine as an environment variable.
